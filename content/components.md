### Components
There are 4 essential components of the architecture, which must conform to the protocols of National Health Stack.

![Components of the Architecture](../images/ProjectEKA-Simplified-Arch.jpg)

- Health Data Access Fiduciary (HDAF): Fiduciary/Trustee that manages patient consents, information flow between HIP and HDAF Clients (HIU and Patient centric Mobile App)
- Health Information User (HIU): A web application to request/fetch/view Patient's Health Information. 
- Patient App: An Android application for patient's to signup with a fiduciary, link accounts with providers, grant consent for HIU request of Health Information, and view patient Health records. In future, this might include even a web portal. 
- Health Information Provider (HIP): A set of useful toolings, like shared Libraries, handling the common workflow/interactions, while providing extension means for plugging HIP specific Health Information System
